# Northcoders News Web app

### Welcome to NC News! ###

NC News is a Reddit style news site written with a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript using React.

A deployed version of the site can be seen here - 

https://mundo-news.netlify.app/

It connects with an API that I previously built which you can find on my GitHub here - 

https://github.com/mundocalrisian/be-nc-news.git

## Install

To start using this project, please first clone the repository from GitHub using the following command

    git clone https://github.com/mundocalrisian/fe-nc-news.git

Next you'll need to install the dependencies by entering the following into the terminal

    npm install

Then to host the page locally, enter

    npm run dev

On loading the site for the first time, you may notice a delay in the articles loading. This is normal whilst the database spins up having not been used for a while.

In order to use some of the features youy will need to be logged in to the site. The login only accepts usernames that are listed in the database which can be seen here -
